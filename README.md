# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- The Prework Study Guide Webpage (PSGW) was developed by me to provide useful content to assist with my career as a front-end developer. It may also have relevence to other developers, in which case that is a bonus.

- I built PSGW to help to reinforce my development by providing useful references relevant to aspects of front-end-web development involving HTML, CSS, Git & Javascript.

- In building this learning resource I have provided a concise point of reference that I can visit to recall core topics pertaining to front end web development. Thereby saving time visiting multiple resources which may not be as concise.

- In developing this project I learned some of the fundimentals of HTML, CSS, Git & Javascript to enable better front-end web development.

## Usage

This PSGW contains specific notes relating to HTML, CSS, Git & JavaScript to provide a speedy and efficient recap of key points relating to each subject, to help reinforce my learning. This resource is a 'live' project and will be updated with additional notes pertaining to each of the subjects.

Additionally, if you open the PSGW in DevTolls console you will see the JavaScript running, which lists all the topics learned. It will also pick a topic for us to study first.
